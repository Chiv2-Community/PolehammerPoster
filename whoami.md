# PolehammerPoster posted an incorrect stat.
There are a couple of reasons an incorrect stat may be posted.
1. The stat is wrong on [polehammer.net](https://polehammer.net). Please submit
   an issue/correction to either to the 
   [github repo](https://github.com/aardvarkk/polehammer) or to 
   [me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Jacoby6000)
2. The AI made it up.  The bot really wants to be helpful. So much that 
   sometimes it makes up stats.  We can control this to some degree using the 
   system prompt.  If this occurs, please 
   [submit an issue](https://github.com/Chiv2-Community/PolehammerPoster/issues)
   or [contact me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Jacoby6000)
3. GPT-4 is very good, but its still very new tech and the AI is still 
   improving. If the stat is correct on 
   [polehammer.net](https://polehammer.net), but wrong in polehammerposter's 
   comment, then this was likely an error in the language model, GPT-4. As the 
   language models improve, these types of errors will become less frequent.
